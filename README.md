# artilleryActionTest
This is a 'test repository' in order to test the artillery github action for the azure function users/userId/tasks/taskId, and store the results into the AWS S3.

Note, the workflow action will not pass until it has been merged with the main NSC repo.

To Test: 
- Push a contentless commit to this repo.
